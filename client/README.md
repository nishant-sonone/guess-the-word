# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Certainly! Frontend development for your Wordle-like game will involve creating various React components, styling them with CSS, and writing JavaScript functions to handle the game logic. Here's a breakdown of the key components and logic you'll need:

### React Components:

1. **App Component (`App.js`):**
   - The root component that will render the entire game.
   - Manages the game state and contains the main logic.
   - Renders other components like `GameBoard`, `Keyboard`, and `WordInfo`.

2. **GameBoard Component (`GameBoard.js`):**
   - Displays the grid where players will see their guesses.
   - Each row represents a guess, and each cell in a row represents a letter.
   - You can represent this as an array of arrays in your state.

3. **Keyboard Component (`Keyboard.js`):**
   - Displays an on-screen keyboard.
   - Each key is a button that players can click to enter a guess.
   - Highlight keys based on feedback (green, yellow, gray).

4. **LetterTile Component (`LetterTile.js`):**
   - Represents each letter cell in the `GameBoard`.
   - Receives props like the letter value and the state (correct position, present, absent).
   - Can be a simple div with different styles based on its state.

5. **WordInfo Component (`WordInfo.js`):**
   - Shows information about the word after a successful guess or game over.
   - Displays definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences.
   - This can be a modal or a separate section on the page.

### CSS Styling:

- Style each component to resemble the look and feel of Wordle.
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to layout the `GameBoard`.
- Style the `Keyboard` with buttons in a layout that resembles a keyboard.
- `LetterTile` can have different classes for different states (correct, present, absent) to change colors.
- Modal or info box styling for `WordInfo`.

### JavaScript Functions for Game Logic:

1. **Initialize Game State:**
   - Store the current guess, all guesses, the current row, and the target word.
   - Example state: `{ currentGuess: '', guesses: Array(6).fill(''), currentRow: 0, targetWord: 'hello' }`.

2. **Handle Key Presses:**
   - Function to update `currentGuess` in the state when a key is pressed.
   - Ensure the guess length does not exceed the target word length.

3. **Submit Guess:**
   - Function to submit the current guess.
   - Validate if the guess is a valid word (can be checked against your word list).
   - Update `guesses` array and increment `currentRow`.

4. **Check Guess:**
   - After a guess is submitted, compare it with the target word.
   - Update each `LetterTile` with the appropriate state (correct position, present, absent).
   - Determine if the player has won or if the game continues.

5. **Reset Game:**
   - Function to reset the game state for a new game.

6. **Fetch Word Info:**
   - After a win or loss, fetch information about the word for the `WordInfo` component.

### Component State Management:

- You can manage state in the `App` component and pass necessary parts of the state and functions as props to child components.
- Consider using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects.

### File Structure in `src` Folder:

- `components/`: Folder to keep all your React components.
- `App.js`: The main application component.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your React application.

### Getting Started with Development:

1. Begin by creating the static layout. Focus on getting your components to render without worrying about the logic.
2. Once the layout is set, start adding interactivity and game logic, beginning with the ability to make guesses and check them against the target word.
3. Add styling as you go or after the basic functionality is working.
4. Test each part of your application thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.

This guide should give you a solid foundation to start developing your game's frontend. Remember, React development can be iterative. Start simple, test often, and gradually add more features and complexity.

In your React project (under the `client` folder), it's important to organize your files in a structured and logical manner. This organization not only makes your project more maintainable but also makes it easier for others (and yourself) to navigate through the code. Here’s how you can set up the file structure for your components:

### Project Structure:

Your `client` folder, which was created when you initialized your React application using `create-react-app`, will have several files and folders. Here's how you can organize your React components within this structure:

```
client/
│
├── public/                  # Public files like index.html
│
├── src/                     # Source files for your React application
│   ├── components/          # Folder to store your components
│   │   ├── GameBoard.js     # GameBoard component
│   │   ├── Keyboard.js      # Keyboard component
│   │   ├── LetterTile.js    # LetterTile component
│   │   ├── WordInfo.js      # WordInfo component
│   │   └── ...              # Other components
│   │
│   ├── App.js               # Root component of your application
│   ├── index.js             # Entry point for React to hook into the DOM
│   └── ...
│
└── ...
```

### Creating Components:

1. **Navigate to the `src` Folder:**
   - Open your `client` folder in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred editor).
   - Find the `src` folder; this is where your React application's source code lives.

2. **Create a `components` Folder:**
   - Inside the `src` folder, create a new folder named `components`.
   - This is where you will store all your React components (`GameBoard.js`, `Keyboard.js`, etc.).

3. **Create Component Files:**
   - Inside the `components` folder, create new JavaScript files for each component.
   - For example, create a file named `GameBoard.js` for the GameBoard component.
   - Repeat this process for `Keyboard.js`, `LetterTile.js`, `WordInfo.js`, and any other components you plan to have.

4. **Write Your Component Code:**
   - Open each JavaScript file you created and define your React components in them.
   - Start with simple functional components that return basic JSX for your layout.

5. **Import Components in `App.js`:**
   - Open `App.js`, which is in the `src` folder.
   - Import the components you created at the top of the `App.js` file.
   - Include these components in the JSX returned by the `App` component.

6. **Style Your Components:**
   - Optionally, you can create a CSS file for each component (e.g., `GameBoard.css`) in the same `components` folder.
   - Import each CSS file into its corresponding component file to apply styles.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-organized project structure with a clear location for each of your React components. This structure not only helps in the current development phase but also ensures that your project is scalable and manageable as it grows.
