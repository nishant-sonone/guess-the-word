Guess the word game:

Core Gameplay:
Word Guessing Mechanic:

Players guess a target word within a limited number of tries (usually six).
Each guess is a valid word of a specific length (commonly five letters).

Feedback System:
Color-coded feedback for each guess:
Green: Letter is in the correct position.
Yellow: Letter is in the word but in a different position.
Gray: Letter is not in the word.

Use curated word list

Difficulty Levels:
Option for easier or more challenging words.

Gameplay Modes:
Classic Mode: Standard gameplay with new word every time game is loaded.

Educational feature:
Focused on learning, After guessing the word players are given more detailed information about it, like its origin, synonyms, antonyms, and an example sentence.

Word Categories:
Allow players to choose or randomize word categories (e.g., animals, technology, geography) for a more tailored gameplay experience.

Step by Step Development plan -
Given your preference for using React, Node.js, Express, and reading words from a file instead of a database, let's revise the tech stack and the folder/file structure accordingly. This approach simplifies the backend by eliminating the need for database management.

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend:
1. **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ideal for creating dynamic single-page applications like your game.
2. **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the game’s content.
3. **JavaScript:** For handling the game logic and React component interactions.

#### Backend:
1. **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side of your application.
2. **Express.js:** A framework for Node.js to simplify the creation of server routes and handling HTTP requests.

#### File for Words:
1. **JSON or Plain Text File:** Store your word list in a JSON or a plain text file. This file will be read by your Node.js server to serve words to the frontend.

#### Additional Tools:
1. **Git & GitHub:** For version control and code collaboration.
2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A code editor, which is great for JavaScript and React development.
3. **Postman:** For testing your server routes.

### Folder/File Structure

Here’s a proposed structure for your project, separating the frontend (React) and backend (Node/Express) code:

```
your-game-name/
│
├── client/                  # Frontend (React)
│   ├── public/              # Public files, including HTML
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── src/                 # React source files
│   │   ├── components/      # React components (e.g., Board, Keyboard)
│   │   ├── App.js           # Main React application component
│   │   ├── index.js         # React entry point
│   │   └── ...
│   └── package.json         # Frontend dependencies and scripts
│
├── server/                  # Backend (Node/Express)
│   ├── wordList.json        # Word list file (or wordList.txt)
│   ├── routes/              # Server routes
│   ├── app.js               # Express app setup
│   └── package.json         # Backend dependencies and scripts
│
├── .gitignore               # Files to be ignored by Git
└── README.md                # Project description and setup instructions
```

### Development Steps

1. **Setting Up the Project:**
   - Initialize a new React app in the `client` folder.
   - Create a new Node.js project in the `server` folder.
   - Initialize Git and create a `.gitignore` file.

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Build the React components for your game (e.g., game board, letter tiles).
   - Use CSS for styling the game interface.
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle game logic (e.g., checking guesses, updating the game state).

3. **Backend Development:**
   - In the `server` directory, set up an Express server.
   - Write a route to send a random word from your word list file to the frontend.
   - Handle HTTP requests from the frontend and send appropriate responses.

4. **Integrating Frontend with Backend:**
   - Use React's `fetch` or `axios` to communicate with your Express server.
   - Retrieve words from the server and handle them in your React application.

5. **Local Testing:**
   - Test the frontend and backend separately and then together to ensure they are integrated properly.
   - Use tools like Postman to test backend routes.

6. **Running the Application Locally:**
   - Use `npm start` in both the `client` and `server` directories to run your frontend and backend locally.

7. **Preparation for Deployment:**
   - Ensure all environment variables and configurations are set for production.
   - Consider hosting options that support Node.js (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, Netlify).

As you progress, remember to frequently commit changes to your Git repository. Since you are new to this, it's essential to refer to documentation and tutorials specific to React, Node.js, and Express as needed. This project structure and tech stack should provide a solid foundation for building and scaling your game.

----------

Basic setup -
Absolutely! Setting up your project involves a few key steps to create the basic structure for both your frontend and backend. Let's break down these steps in detail:

### 1. **Install Necessary Software:**
   - **Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. npm comes with Node.js, which you can download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - **Git:** Install Git for version control. You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).
   - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** While any code editor will work, VS Code is recommended for its excellent support for JavaScript and React. Download it from the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 2. **Create a New Directory for Your Project:**
   - Create a new folder on your local machine where you want your project to reside. For example, you can create a folder named `wordle-game`.

### 3. **Initialize Git Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory (`wordle-game`).
   - Run `git init`. This initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.

### 4. **Set Up the Backend (Node/Express):**
   - Inside the `wordle-game` folder, create a new folder named `server`.
   - Open this `server` folder in your terminal.
   - Run `npm init -y`. This creates a `package.json` file with default values.
   - Install Express by running `npm install express`.
   - Create a new file named `app.js`. This will be your main server file.
   - Write a basic Express server in `app.js`. Here’s a simple example:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3001; // Backend server port

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
     });
     ```

### 5. **Set Up the Frontend (React):**
   - Open a new terminal window (don't close your backend terminal).
   - Navigate back to your main project folder (`wordle-game`).
   - Create the React frontend by running `npx create-react-app client`. This creates a new React application in a folder named `client`.
   - Wait for the process to complete; it might take a few minutes.

### 6. **Folder Structure Overview:**
   - Your project directory should now have two main subdirectories: `client` (for React frontend) and `server` (for Node/Express backend).
   - The `client` folder will have its own `node_modules`, `src`, `public`, and `package.json`.
   - The `server` folder will have `node_modules`, `app.js`, and `package.json`.

### 7. **Run Both Applications Locally:**
   - **For Backend:**
     - In your `server` terminal, run `node app.js` to start the Express server.
     - It should display a message like “Server running on http://localhost:3001”.
   - **For Frontend:**
     - Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` folder.
     - Run `npm start`. This starts the React development server, usually on `http://localhost:3000`.
     - Your default web browser should open automatically displaying your React app.

### 8. **Version Control with Git:**
   - Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory.
   - Add `node_modules/` and other unnecessary files to `.gitignore`.
   - Use Git commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to manage your code versions and backups.

### Next Steps:
Once your basic setup is complete, you can start developing your game. Begin by building the frontend interface in React and setting up the backend logic to serve words from your file in the `server` directory. Test regularly to ensure everything is working as expected.

Feel free to refer to documentation for [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) as you progress.

Build & Deploy

Hosting your game on AWS involves several steps, including building your React app for production, setting up the backend on Elastic Beanstalk, and optionally using Amazon S3 and CloudFront for hosting and distributing your frontend. I'll guide you through each step.

### Prerequisites:

- An AWS account.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your computer.
- Your project should have a separate directory for the frontend (React app) and the backend (Node.js app).

### Part 1: Building and Deploying the Frontend

**1. Build Your React App:**

   - Navigate to your frontend directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/frontend`).
   - Run the build command:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - This creates a `build` folder in your frontend directory containing the production build.

**2. Upload the Build to S3:**

   - Create an S3 bucket via AWS Management Console.
   - Enable static website hosting in the bucket settings.
   - Upload the contents of the `build` folder to the S3 bucket.
   - Update the bucket policy for public access.

**3. (Optional) Set Up CloudFront:**

   - Create a new CloudFront distribution.
   - Set the S3 bucket as the origin.
   - Use the CloudFront domain to access your site.

### Part 2: Deploying the Backend on Elastic Beanstalk

**1. Prepare Your Backend Application:**

   - Navigate to your backend directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/backend`).
   - Make sure your `package.json` includes a start script (`"start": "node index.js"`).
   - Zip the contents of your backend directory, excluding `node_modules`.

**2. Deploy Using Elastic Beanstalk:**

   - Open the Elastic Beanstalk console and create a new application.
   - Create a new environment within your application.
   - Choose the Node.js platform and upload the zipped source code.
   - Configure the environment (set environment variables if needed).

### Part 3: Connecting Frontend with Backend

- Update your frontend application to make requests to the Elastic Beanstalk environment URL.
- Rebuild your frontend and re-upload to S3 if you made any changes.

### Part 4: (Optional) Database Setup

If your application requires a database, set it up using Amazon RDS or DynamoDB and connect it to your backend.

### Important Points:

- **Security:** Review and apply necessary security measures. Ensure your S3 bucket is not publicly writable, use IAM roles and policies for access control, and configure security groups in Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Domain and SSL:** For a custom domain, use Route 53 and associate it with your CloudFront distribution. For SSL, you can use AWS Certificate Manager.
- **Monitoring and Cost Management:** Regularly monitor your usage and billing. AWS CloudWatch can be helpful for monitoring the health and performance of your application.

Deploying on AWS offers scalability and reliability, but it requires careful setup and management. Make sure to test each part thoroughly after deployment. If you're new to AWS, the AWS documentation and AWS CLI guide will be helpful resources.
